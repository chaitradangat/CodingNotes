Baked into Azure App Service is the ability to scale up/down or scale out/in.
Depending on the usage of the web app, you can scale your app up/down the resources of the underlying machine that is hosting your web app.Resources include the number of cores or the amount of RAM available.
Scaling out/in is the ability to increase, or decrease, the number of machine instances that are running your web app.

#####Deployment slots
Using the Azure portal, or command-line tools, you can easily add deployment slots to an App Service web app. 
For instance, you can create a staging deployment slot where you can push your code to test on Azure. 
Once you are happy with your code, you can easily swap the staging deployment slot with the production slot. 
You do all this with a few simple mouse clicks in the Azure portal.
