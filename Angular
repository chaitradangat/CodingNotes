0>Angular Modules
@NgModule({
 imports: [modules on which this module depends..similar to using statement in C#],
 declarations: [The components declared in this module...similar to class properties in C# ],
 exports: [the components to be made available outside this module when it is imported by other module]
})

1> There are two types of Angular modules: feature modules and the root module.Feature modules are used to group related application functionality to make the application easier to manage.

2> Feature module for exporting and importing angular features
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
const features: any[] = [];
@NgModule({
 imports: [features],
 exports: [features]
})
export class MaterialFeatures {}

3> Routing feature modules
Dynamically loaded modules are managed through the routing configuration, which triggers the loading 
process when the application navigates to a specific URL.

let routing = RouterModule.forChild([
 { path: "auth", component: AuthComponent },
 { path: "main", component: AdminComponent },
 {
 path: "admin",
 loadChildren: () => import("./admin/admin.module")
 .then(m => m.AdminModule),
 canActivate: [StoreFirstGuard]
},
{ path: "**", redirectTo: "auth" }
]);

4>Routing by using code
The URL routing feature relies on a JavaScript API provided by the browser, which means the user can’t simply type the target URL into the browser’s URL bar. 
import { Router } from "@angular/router";
this.router.navigateByUrl("/cart");

5>Strictly speaking, the @Injectable decorator is required only when a class has its own constructor 
arguments to resolve, but it is a good idea to apply it anyway because it serves as a signal that the class is 
intended for use as a service.

6>Usage of activated route
constructor(private repository: ProductRepository,
private router: Router,
activeRoute: ActivatedRoute) {
this.editing = activeRoute.snapshot.params["mode"] == "edit";
if (this.editing) {
Object.assign(this.product,
repository.getProduct(activeRoute.snapshot.params["id"]));
}
}

7> Nested <router-outlet/> and child component routing
let routing = RouterModule.forChild([
 { path: "auth", component: AuthComponent },
 {
 path: "main", component: AdminComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard],
 children: [
 { path: "products/:mode/:id", component: ProductEditorComponent },
 { path: "products/:mode", component: ProductEditorComponent },
 { path: "products", component: ProductTableComponent },
 { path: "orders", component: OrderTableComponent },
 { path: "**", redirectTo: "products" }
 ]
 },
 { path: "**", redirectTo: "auth" }
]);

8>ViewChild decorator example in the mattable component
The ViewChild decorator is used to query the component’s template content, and is used here to find the paginator component.
@ViewChild(MatPaginator)
paginator? : MatPaginator

9>rxJs piping
The pipe method and map function are provided by the RxJS package, and they allow the response event 
from the server, which is presented through an Observable<any> to be transformed into an event in the 
Observable<bool> that is the result of the authenticate method

10>switching the implementation of providers
providers: [ProductRepository, StaticDataSource, Cart, Order, OrderRepository,{ provide: StaticDataSource, useClass: RestDataSource }]

11>splice angular
updateOrder(order: Order) {
this.dataSource.updateOrder(order).subscribe(order => {
this.orders.splice(this.orders.
findIndex(o => o.id == order.id), 1, order);
});
}

12> Angular Bindings are done using using Brackets and Parantheses
Different types of angular bindings are as below
Data Binding
One way data binding
Two way data binding
Attribute binding
Event Binding
String interpolation bindings

A>Angular Class Binding
<div [ngClass]="getClasses()" >
 Hello, World.
</div>

B>The target specifies what the binding will do. 
There are two different types of target: a directive or a property binding.

C> Angular Directives
The target for the data binding is a directive, which is a class that is specifically written to support a data 
binding. Angular comes with some useful built-in directives, and you can create your own to provide custom 
functionality.The names of the built-in directives start with ng.

ngClass This directive is used to assign host elements to classes, as described in the “Setting 
Classes and Styles” section.

ngStyle This directive is used to set individual styles, as described in the “Setting Classes 
and Styles” section.

ngIf This directive is used to insert content in the HTML document when its expression 
evaluates as true, as described in Chapter 11.

ngFor This directive inserts the same content into the HTML document for each item in a 
data source, as described in Chapter 11.

ngSwitch
ngSwitchCase
ngSwitchDefault
ngModel

These directives are used to choose between blocks of content to insert into the 
HTML document based on the value of the expression, as described in Chapter 11.

ngTemplateOutlet This directive is used to repeat a block of content, as described in Chapter 11.

D> Property Binding
If the binding target doesn’t correspond to a directive, then Angular checks to see whether the target can 
be used to create a property binding. There are five different types of property binding

E>Angular will still process the binding if you omit the brackets and the 
target is a directive, but the expression won’t be evaluated, and the content between the quote characters 
will be passed to the directive as a literal value.

F>types of brackets in angular
[target]="expr" The square brackets indicate a one-way data binding where data flows from the 
expression to the target. The different forms of this type of binding are the topic of 
this chapter.

{{expression}} This is the string interpolation binding, which is described in the “Using the 
String Interpolation Binding” section.

(target) ="expr" The round brackets indicate a one-way binding where the data flows from the 
target to the destination specified by the expression. This is the binding used to 
handle events, as described in Chapter 12.

[(target)] ="expr" This combination of brackets—known as the banana-in-a-box—indicates a 
two-way binding, where data flows in both directions between the target and the 
destination specified by the expression, as described in Chapter 12.

G>Attribute Binding Example
<table class="table mt-2">
 <tr>
 <th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td [attr.colspan]="model.getProducts().length">
 {{model.getProduct(1)?.name ?? 'None'}}
 </td>
 </tr>
</table>

H>*ngIf *ngFor The asterisk before the directive name indicates that this is a microtemplate directive

I> *ngFor optimization , Two Product objects will be considered equal if they have the same id value. Telling the ngFor expression 
to use the comparison method is done by adding a trackBy term to the expression.

J>The ng-container element can be used to apply directives without using an HTML element

K> expression context

L> Event Binding
An event binding has these four parts:
•	 The host element is the source of events for the binding.
•	 The round brackets tell Angular that this is an event binding, which is a form of oneway binding where data flows from the element to the rest of the application.
•	 The event specifies which event the binding is for.
•	 The expression is evaluated when the event is triggered.
Unlike one-way bindings, the expressions in event bindings can make changes to the state of the 
application and can contain assignment operators, such as =.

M>
When the browser triggers an event, it provides an Event object that describes it.There are different types of event objects for different categories of events (mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and so 
on), but all events share the three properties described in 
*type This property returns a string that identifies the type of event that has been triggered.
*target This property returns the object that triggered the event, which will generally be the object that represents the HTML element in the DOM.
*timeStamp This property returns a number that contains the time that the event was triggered, expressed as milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

N> custom directives structural directive
constructor(element: ElementRef, @Attribute("pa-attr-class") bgClass: string) {
 element.nativeElement.classList.add(bgClass || "table-success", "fw-bold");
 }

O> ng add command
Notice that this command is ng add, rather than the npm install command that I use elsewhere for adding packages. 
The ng add command is used specifically to install packages, such as @angular/pwa, that have been designed to enhance or reconfigure an Angular project.
ng add @angular/pwa

P> Angular Data Model
Data Model can be broken into three parts.
•	 One or more classes that describe the data in the model
•	 A data source that loads and saves data, typically to a server
•	 A repository that allows the data in the model to be manipulated

Q> The styles property is set to an array, where each item contains a CSS selector and one or more 
properties.

R> enums and usage
export enum LogLevel {
 DEBUG, INFO, ERROR
}
minimumLevel: LogLevel = LogLevel.INFO;

S> Directives with asterix* that use micro-templates are known as structural directives
*ngIf
*ngFor
ngSwitch
*ngSwitchCase

A> Module provider scope
There is no module-wide scope for providers, which means that the providers defined by a feature module will be available as though they had been defined by the 
root module.
When you add a module to the imports property, its declarable classes are automatically available for use in the application.

B> providers array for services
The providers property is used to define the service providers that will be used to resolve dependencies when there are no suitable local providers available.

C> index.ts use folder name instead of filename like this import { Product, Model } from "./model";
To use a JavaScript module, add a file called index.ts alongside the TypeScript file that defines the Angular module, which is the src/app/model folder for the examples in this 
section. For each of the application features that you want to use outside of the application, add an export...from statement, like this:
...
export { ModelModule } from "./model.module";
export { Product } from "./product.model";
export { SimpleDataSource } from "./datasource.model";
export { Model } from "./repository.model";
...

D> imports export property in NgModule 
When the common module is imported, all of the types listed in its exports property will be added to the root module’s declarations property.

E> Creating Feature Modules with :
Model Module
Utility Module
Component Module

F>Forms API
*Creating a reactive form 
Create a FormControl object in the component class and associate it with a form element in the template using the formControl directive

*Responding to element value changes
Use the observable valueChanges property defined by the FormControl class

*Responding to element validation changes
Use the observable statusChanges property defined by the FormControl class

*Managing element state 
Use the properties defined by the FormControl class

*Defining multiple related form elements
Use a FormGroup object

*Displaying validation messages for controls in a group
Obtain a FormControl object through the enclosing FormGroup object

G>REST Convention
GET /products This combination retrieves all the objects in the products collection.
GET /products/2 This combination retrieves the object whose id is 2 from the products collection.
POST /products This combination is used to add a new object to the products collection. The request body contains a JSON representation of the new object.
PUT /products/2 This combination is used to replace the object in the products collection whose id is 2. The request body contains a JSON representation of the replacement object.
PATCH /products/2 This combination is used to update a subset of the properties of the object in the products collection whose id is 2. The request body contains a JSON representation of the properties to update and the new values.
DELETE /products/2 This combination is used to delete the product whose id is 2 from the products
collection.

H>The HttpClient Methods
get(url) This method sends a GET request to the specified URL.
post(url, body) This method sends a POST request using the specified object as the body.
put(url, body) This method sends a PUT request using the specified object as the body.
patch(url, body) This method sends a PATCH request using the specified object as the body.
delete(url) This method sends a DELETE request to the specified URL.
head(url) This method sends a HEAD request, which has the same effect as a GET request except that the server will return only the headers and not the request body.
options(url) This method sends an OPTIONS request to the specified URL.
request(method, url, options) This method can be used to send a request with any verb

A> HttpClient object will automatically convert the response into an Observable that yields an instance of the type parameter when it completes.
private sendRequest<T>(verb: string, url: string, body?: Product): Observable<T> {
 return this.http.request<T>(verb, url, {
 body: body
 });
 }

B> Two URLs are considered to be in the same origin if they have the same protocol, host, and port and have different origins if this is not the case. 

C> Generic HttpClient.request method
import { catchError, Observable } from "rxjs";
return this.http.request<T>(verb, url, {
 body: body,
 headers: myHeaders
 }).pipe(catchError((error: Response) => {
 throw(`Network Error: ${error.statusText} (${error.status})`)
 }));

D> Routing
The routing configuration is defined as a set of fragments that are used to match the browser’s URL and to select a component whose template is displayed as the content of an HTML element called router-outlet.
path             specifies the path for the route.
component        specifies the component that will be selected when the active URL matches the path.
pathMatch        tells Angular how to match the current URL to the path property. 
redirectTo       create a route that redirects the browser to a different URL when activated.
children         specify child routes, which display additional components in nested router-outlet elements contained in the template of the active component.
outlet           support multiple outlet elements.
resolve          define work that must be completed before a route can be activated.
canActivate      control when a route can be activated.
canActivateChild control when a child route can be activated.
canDeactivate    control when a route can be deactivated so that a new route can be activated.
loadChildren     configure a module that is loaded only when it is needed.
canLoad          control when an on-demand module can be loaded.

E> Routing Order
The most specific routes should be defined first, with the routes that follow decreasing in specificity.

F> Angular Routing Sample Code
import { Routes, RouterModule } from "@angular/router";
import { TableComponent } from "./core/table.component";
import { FormComponent } from "./core/form.component";

const routes: Routes = [
 { path: "form/edit", component: FormComponent },
 { path: "form/create", component: FormComponent },
 { path: "", component: TableComponent }]

export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(routes);

G>The routerLink attribute applies a directive from the routing package that performs the navigation change. 
<button class="btn btn-warning btn-sm" (click)="editProduct(item.id)"
 [routerLink]="['/form', 'edit', item.id]">

H> Route Parameters
{ path: "form/:mode", component: FormComponent }
http://localhost:4200/form         No match—too few segments
http://localhost:4200/form/create  Matches, with create assigned to the mode parameter
http://localhost:4200/form/london  Matches, with london assigned to the mode parameter
http://localhost:4200/product/edit No match—the first segment is not form
http://localhost:4200/form/edit/1  No match—too many segments
