--Loading strategies in entity framework
• Eager loading: The related data is loaded from the database as part of the initial query.
• Explicit loading: The related data is explicitly loaded from the database at a later time.
• Lazy loading: The related data is transparently loaded from the database when the entity navigation property is accessed for the first time. This is the most complex pattern among the 
                three and might suffer some serious performance impacts when not implemented properly.
				
-- Eager Loading
var country = await _context.Countries
.Include(c => c.Cities)
.FindAsync(id);
return country; // country.Cities is (eagerly) loaded
