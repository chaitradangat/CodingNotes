What is a daemon

https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

When you install Docker, you get two major components:
• the Docker client
• the Docker daemon (sometimes called “server” or “engine”)

In a docker file  each line represents an instruction that is used to build an image

* $ docker container run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
* docker container run -it microsoft/powershell:nanoserver pwsh.exe

Look closely at the output from the previous commands. You should notice that the shell prompt has changed in each instance. 
This is because the -it flags switch your shell into the terminal of the container — you are literally inside of the new container!
